            <p>My most recent role I was responsible for extraction of medical records so that these records could then be included within our clients medical reports. The role required someone techincal for the job as it meant working with various portals and discs from various vendors using various different applications. On starting this new role the department was two weeks behind on service level agreement over the next 6 weeks I worked 11 hour shifts in order to get us back within SLA. One task I was responsible for was the encryption of none password protected discs, about a third of records received on disc were not password protected meaning I had to take longer to deal with, I began a log of those hospitals that have protected their discs and those that had not, once I had collected these details I approached Hospitals who have not password protected and asked if they could update their process to be GDPR compliant. This meant that the volume that was coming through our department required less time to encrypt.</p>

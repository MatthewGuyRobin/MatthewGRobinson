                <p> I am currently on an apprenticeship at Code Nation studying to be a software developer. I have taken the
                decision to further myself by developing skills within the tech industry as this is what I am passionate
                about. Since being a child I was always interested in how and why technology worked while most boys my
                age were playing offline on their Playstation 2, I was playing on a computer online with real people
                around the world, this is what first opened my eyes to the possibilities of technology.</p>
